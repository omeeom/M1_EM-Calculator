\item This document specifies the functional requirements for a multi-\/function calculator program.
\item The program is designed to act like a “handheld calculator” with the usual standard functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide, exponentiation).
\item Additionally, the calculator will have the additional capability of performing functions based on electrical parameters like (voltage,current,resistance,power,frequency,impedence,period,charge and conductance).
\item The program is designed to be as easy to use as a regular calculator.
\item This is a C-\/based command-\/line calculator that supports typical mathematical operations as well as a collection of functions.
\item Commands are entered using conventional infix syntax, with parenthesis indicating nonstandard operation order.
\item Apart from normal calculator some basic electrical parameters can also be calculated with the help of ~\newline
 EM-\/\+Calculator.

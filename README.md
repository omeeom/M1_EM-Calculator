# Electro Mathematical Calculator
* This document specifies the functional requirements for a multi-function calculator program.
* The program is designed to act like a “handheld calculator” with the usual standard functions
  (add, subtract, multiply, divide, exponentiation). 
* Additionally, the calculator will have the additional capability of performing functions based on 
  electrical parameters like (voltage,current,resistance,power,frequency,impedence,period,charge and conductance).
* The program is designed to be as easy to use as a regular calculator.
* This is a C-based command-line calculator that supports typical mathematical operations as well as a 
  collection of functions. 
* Commands are entered using conventional infix syntax, with parenthesis indicating nonstandard 
  operation order. 
* Apart from normal calculator some basic electrical parameters can also be calculated with the help of  
  EM-Calculator.
